# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-09

This Privacy Policy applies to the **Deadsign** mobile application (the **"Application"**) developed by **Serhii Dankovych** (the **"Service Provider"**) and provided as a **Free** service. The Application is provided **"AS IS"**, without warranties of any kind.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Application operates as a **privacy-first service**.

**The Application does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.** No personally identifiable user information is retained by the Service Provider or any third-party services.

### User-Provided Data
All personal data you enter into the Application is stored **only on your device** via local storage mechanisms (AsyncStorage and FileSystem). This includes:
* Name
* Date of birth
* Country
* Life expectancy

From this information, the Application calculates derived values (such as age, weeks lived) locally.

### Log Data
The Application does **not** collect:
* Log data
* IP addresses
* Device identifiers (AdID, IDFA)
* Location data
* Analytics or usage statistics

## 2. Image Generation and File Handling

The Application includes features that allow you to generate visual representations (such as Life Table images).

### Backend API Processing
Life Table images are generated by a **remote API** operated by the Service Provider. When you request a Life Table image, the Application sends the following parameters to this API:

* **Date of birth** (formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`)
* **Life expectancy** (a numeric value)

These parameters are transmitted solely to generate the requested image and are **not stored, logged, or retained** by the API. No account information, name, or other personal data is included in these requests.

The API responds with a PNG image, which is temporarily cached in the Application's internal sandbox storage for display or sharing purposes. This cache is managed locally on your device and is cleared automatically.

### Saving and Sharing
If you choose to save or share a generated image, the Application utilizes standard system sharing capabilities.
* The Application does **not** require direct access permissions to your photo gallery or media library.
* The Application does **not** scan, analyze, or extract metadata from your existing photos.
* Generated images are **not** uploaded to any server beyond the image generation request described above.

## 3. Notifications and Alarms

The Application uses **local notifications** to provide reminders.

On Android devices, permissions such as `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` and `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` are utilized. These permissions are required **only** to ensure notifications are delivered at the specific times scheduled by the user.

All notifications are scheduled locally. No notification data is sent to external push notification services (such as FCM or APNs).

## 4. Third-Party Services

The Application integrates with the following services:

* **Deadsign API** — Used exclusively to render Life Table images. Only date of birth and life expectancy are transmitted. No data is stored server-side.
* **Firebase Realtime Database** (Google) — Used to fetch read-only app content such as country life expectancy data, age options, motivation quotes, greeting messages, notification presets, and life stats configuration. This is a one-way data fetch; no user data is sent to or stored in Firebase.

The Application does **not** integrate with:
* Third-party analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics)
* Firebase Analytics or Firebase Crashlytics
* Advertising networks
* Tracking SDKs

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

The Service Provider does not maintain any external database of user information.

### Retention
All personal data remains on your device until you decide to remove it. Cloud backups are explicitly disabled in the Application configuration. Data transmitted to the image generation API is used only to fulfill the immediate request and is not retained.

### Deletion
You may delete all user data instantly by:
1. Using the **Reset All Data** option inside the Application settings.
2. Uninstalling the Application.
3. Clearing the Application's storage via your device's system settings.

Once these actions are taken, the data is permanently removed from the device and cannot be recovered.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Application does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The limited data transmitted to the image generation API (date of birth and life expectancy) is not linked to any identity and is not retained. No children's data is exposed to the Service Provider or third parties.

## 7. Security

Personal data entered into the Application is stored locally, so its security relies on your device's security (screen lock, encryption). The Service Provider has configured the Application to disallow automatic cloud backups (`allowBackup: false`) to ensure your data remains strictly on your device.

Data transmitted to the image generation API is sent over HTTPS and is not stored server-side.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Continued use of the Application after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
